package com.org.oops.Abstraction._interface;
// This program is used demonstrate that can we provide any implementation to method inside the interface
interface Interface_02 {
   //creating the method details
/*	public void details() {
		System.out.println("Hello there ! i am the method inside an interface");
	}//here we get compile time error
*/
/*	Explanation:-
	When we create a method inside an interface it is bydefault declare as public and abstract.
	And abstract method doesn't have body part.For that reason we cannot create concrete method inside an interface.
